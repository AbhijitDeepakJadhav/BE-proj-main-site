# BE-proj-main-site (Covid Based Society Monitoring System)

Technologies: Raspberry Pi 3B+, MFRC522(RFID reader), MLX90614(IR temperature sensor), Python-Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS EC2.

From this project idea, we can successfully implement a system that can analyze the real-time data of society members entering and exiting from the society with their temperature. Our proposed system can detect a human face mask in a real-time world. This data can be seen by each member as well as admin on the society website.

This repository has applicaion code for society website.
